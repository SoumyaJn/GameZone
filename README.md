# Browser-Game

   Online Gaming is becoming more prevalant as the number of online users are increasing rapidly.
   In addition to being fun, playing video games can reduce stress, lighten depression, increase vision, improve the ability to multi-task and improve decision-making skills.
   But due to recent MMORPGs and other games that involves brutal and extreme graphics,peoples are forgetting the peaceful and strategy based games like chess,tic tac toe,...etc that were played among friends and family with enthusiasm.
The main goal of our project is to revive the legacy video games that are forgotten in this ever growing world.

# Approach
We propose to build a website that will host free legacy games and players can play with friends(online multiplayer) or play with computer,just like the old days.

# Progress
1.First of all, player will be asked to login or Sign Up(if they haven't logged in before) so that their name can be registed in the Leaderboard
